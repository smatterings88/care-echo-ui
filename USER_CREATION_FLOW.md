# User Creation Flow - What Happens After Admin Creates a User

## Current Implementation

### ‚úÖ What Works Now
1. **Firebase Auth Account Created**
   - Email/password authentication set up
   - Display name configured
   - User can login immediately

2. **Firestore Document Created**
   - User data stored with role, agency, timestamps
   - Agency user count updated
   - User appears in admin dashboard

3. **Immediate Access**
   - User can login with provided credentials
   - Access to dashboard and survey features
   - Role-based permissions enforced

### ‚ùå What's Missing
1. **No Email Notification**
   - User doesn't know their account was created
   - No welcome email with login instructions
   - No password sharing mechanism

2. **No Agency Assignment UI**
   - Admin can't assign users to agencies during creation
   - No agency dropdown in create user form
   - Users created without agency association

3. **No User Management**
   - Edit/Update user information
   - Deactivate/Reactivate users
   - Reset passwords
   - Change user roles

4. **No Onboarding Flow**
   - No first-time login experience
   - No profile completion prompts
   - No agency selection for users

## Complete User Creation Flow (Recommended)

### 1. Admin Creates User
```

```

**Form Fields:**
- Full Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Password (required)
- Role (user/agency/admin)

### 2. System Actions
```

2. Create Firestore user document
3. Update agency user count
4. Send welcome email (if enabled)
5. Log creation activity
6. Refresh admin dashboard
```

### 3. User Receives Notification
```
Email: "Welcome to CareEcho"
- Login credentials
- First-time setup instructions
- Link to login page
- Contact information for help
```

### 4. User First Login
```
1. User visits login page
2. Enters provided credentials
3. System detects first login
4. Redirects to onboarding/profile setup
5. User completes profile
6. Redirects to dashboard
```

### 5. Ongoing Access
```
- Dashboard access based on role
- Survey access for all users
- Admin features for admin users
- Agency management for agency users
```
